# TFT-Display

This project is about Airsense display using TFT ILI9341. I use TFT_eSPI as driver to interface with display and LVGL 8 library for drawing.

I created 2 screens:
- Screen 1: shows data, time, wifi status, sd status, airsense and SPARC Lab logo.
- Screen 2: you can configure wifi with this screen. It has wifi list, password box, keyboard,... to help you configure wifi.
